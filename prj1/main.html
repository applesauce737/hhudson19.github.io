                <h2>Computer Science</h2>
                <p>I got into computer science because of my love of the English grammar.
                    I have a love of doing exasperatingly boring detail work, so I'm 
                    enjoying my current classes about programming languages and web design
                    quite a bit.

                <h2>Writing</h2>
                <p>I enjoy writing essays and short stories, as well as creating
                    documentation for computer science projects. Currently, I am
                    enjoying studying logic in Discrete math, as it applies really
                    well to arguments in rhetoric.

                <h2>Knitting</h2>
                <p>My current project is a forrest green sweater. I also have a theory
                    that knitting is just binary but better looking.

        <!-- my favorite verse -->
        <p>Colossians 2:2-3 (ESV) that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit
            together in love, to reach all the riches of the full assurance of understanding
            and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ, in whom are hidden
            all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
