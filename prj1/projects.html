            <p>This year I am working on an automated basketball shot optimization project
            for Dr. Slegers. My team and I are working on a software program to analyze
            video and do ai image processing to get (x, y) and time values to help basketball
            players improve their shooting form.</p>

        <p>Colossians 2:2-3 (ESV) that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit
            together in love, to reach all the riches of the full assurance of understanding
            and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ, in whom are hidden
            all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
