            <h2>Why Knitting is Just Binary</h2>
            <p>Knitting consists of two stitches, knitting and purling.
              One of these makes a little bump in the front of your knitting, and one makes a bump in the back.
              Like ones and zeroes, right?
              It would be so cool to try to knit a program
              in binary form, but it probably wouldn't look
              nice. It <i>would</i> make a pretty neat blanket though.

              The photo below is a picture of a knitting diagram
              where the stitches are indicated by symbols,
              which looks exceptionally like a binary pattern
              except for some of the special stitches for
              increasing and decreasing.

    <footer>
        <!-- my favorite verse -->
        <p>Colossians 2:2-3 (ESV) that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit
            together in love, to reach all the riches of the full assurance of understanding
            and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ, in whom are hidden
            all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
