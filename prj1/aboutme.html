            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a senior at George Fox University and I've spent most of my life
            in southern Idaho, but now I live permanently in Newberg..
            My favorite season is summer, and my favorite book is <i>Little Women</i>.
            I like drinking peppermint tea, knitting, sewing, and watching old movies with my husband, Nathaniel.

        <!-- my favorite verse -->
        <p>Colossians 2:2-3 (ESV) that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit
            together in love, to reach all the riches of the full assurance of understanding
            and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ, in whom are hidden
            all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
