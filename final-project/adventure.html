    <h2>Airborn</h2>
    <h3>by Kenneth Oppel</h3>
    <p>Matt Cruse is a cabin boy on the Aurora, a huge airship that sails hundreds of feet above the ocean, ferrying wealthy passengers from city to city. It is the life Matt's always wanted; convinced he's lighter than air, he imagines himself as buoyant as the hydrium gas that powers his ship. One night he meets a dying balloonist who speaks of beautiful creatures drifting through the skies. It is only after Matt meets the balloonist's granddaughter that he realizes that the man's ravings may, in fact, have been true, and that the creatures are completely real and utterly mysterious.</p>

    <h2>Alas Babylon</h2>
    <h3>by Pat Frank</h3>
    <p>“Alas, Babylon.” Those fateful words heralded the end. When the unthinkable nightmare of nuclear holocaust ravaged the United States, it was instant death for tens of millions of people; for survivors, it was a nightmare of hunger, sickness, and brutality.<br><br>

But for one small Florida town, miraculously spared against all the odds, the struggle was only just beginning, as the isolated survivors found the courage to come together and confront the harrowing darkness.</p>

    <h2>The Book of the King</h2>
    <h3>by Jerry B. Jenkins and Chris Fabry</h3>
    <p>"Nothing special" is the best way to describe Owen Reeder--at least that's what he's been told all his life. When a stranger visits his father's bookstore, Owen's ordinary life spirals out of control and right into a world he didn't even know existed. Owen believes the only gift he possesses is his ability to devour books, but he is about to be forced into a battle that will affect two worlds: his and the unknown world of the Lowlands. Perfect for readers ages 10 to 14 who enjoy a fast-paced story packed with action, fantasy, and humor.</p>
