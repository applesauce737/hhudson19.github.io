    <h2>The Book of the King</h2>
    <h3>by Jerry B. Jenkins and Chris Fabry</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite "Christian teen" books I've ever found. I'm obligated to call it that because I've never been able to find it outside of a church library. That said, this book rivals the story of Harry Potter in it's imagination and storytelling power.<br><br>
    Set in England's Downs, a once idyllic rural landscape, this stirring tale of adventure, courage and survival follows a band of very special creatures on their flight from the intrusion of man and the certain destruction of their home. Led by a stouthearted pair of friends, they journey forth from their native Sandleford Warren through the harrowing trials posed by predators and adversaries, to a mysterious promised land and a more perfect society.</p>
